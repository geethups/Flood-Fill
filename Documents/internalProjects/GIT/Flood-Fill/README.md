# Flood Fill

Here comes the door to share our issues and thoughts internally, without exposing to the outer world. And getting the right reference at the right time. The motivation is: Many times I referred my older projects to solve issues, similar issues can comes several times. Then I thought, if one of my team-mate got an issue that I have faced before, surely I can help. But when it be someone else, how could I know? And he will do the same google search, lot of trials, that I have done before. So if we share our issues and solution internally, it will be a great thing.

Flood Fill is mainly focus to point out your technical issues and get solution immediately. It is an open room for discussing your coding issues with all of the QBurstanians including developers, team leads and architects. You can have the provision to add your question in any platform, share your answer, and also promote solutions.

There will be a registration form for new user. Admin will approve the newly registered user. Once get approved, user can login to their home and post their questions. On adding a new question, it will be appeared to the site home page and will be available to all user to post their version of solution. Architects will review the solutions and provide their comments.
